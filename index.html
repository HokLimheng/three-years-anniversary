        <p>
          Three years ago, I found someone who makes every day brighter, every
          laugh louder, and every moment more meaningful. You've been my best
          friend, my confidant, and my greatest adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the ups and downs, your love has been my constant. I cherish
          every memory we've created together, and I'm excited for all that's
          yet to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's to us – to three incredible years and to a lifetime of love
          ahead. I love you more than words can express, more than stars in the
          sky, and more than coffee on Monday mornings! ☕️

        <p>
          You are my today, my tomorrow, and my always. Thank you for being the
